## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Built

This entire project was created using **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google's advanced AI) and **Cursor** (the AI-powered code editor). Every feature, from backend logic to frontend polish, was designed, coded, and iterated with the help of these tools. This README, too, was generated by Cursor!
